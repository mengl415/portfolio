        <p class="introML">
        MindLog is an app meant to help an individual organize and reflect on
        their own emotions, behaviors, and triggers. By mapping out their
        emotional state consistently over the course of weeks, months, and even
        years, MindLog will then analyze the user’s inputs and provide a
        comprehensive synthesis of their behaviors and tendencies and suggest
        next steps. Inputs can range from as simple as only the emotion felt or
        include a variety of other parameters such as related conflicts,
        relationships, intensity, and more. Rather than replace professional
        help or therapy, MindLog aims to have the user help themselves by
        creating a regular routine of reflection.

        <div class="bigTextML">
          Young adults acknowledge their mental health issues but lack sustainable and accessible methods of tackling them.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyML">
          The topic of mental health is less stigmatized in the current
          generation of young adults, but many of us grapple with factors like cost, time, and resources to engage with our own
          mental health in meaningful and effective ways. How can we change
          this?

        <div class="hLine"></div>
        <div class="subheadML">RESEARCH</div>
        <div class="bigTextML">Research Objectives</div>
        <div class="bodyML">
          1. Investigate young adults’ attitudes toward mental health and how
          they talk about it.<br /><br />2. Investigate ways young adults care
          for their own mental health.<br /><br />3. Understand factors that
          inhibit young adults from seeking mental health care.<br /><br />4.
          Understand how inadequate mental health care affects young adults.<br /><br />5.
          Investigate the physical and virtual spaces that young adults discuss
          mental health in.

        <div class="subheadML">DESK RESEARCH</div>
        <div class="bigTextML">
          Perceived stress in stress-inducing experiences is a major factor in
          low mental health.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyML">
          Beginning with desk research, an important and surprising slap stat
          stuck out to me. Perceived stress includes all aspects of external
          sources of stress relevant to an individual rather than the source of
          stress by itself. In other words, it’s the individual’s feelings on
          how much stress they’re experiencing from a single source.
        </div>
        <div class="subheadML">USER INTERVIEWS & SURVEY</div>
        <div class="bodyML">
          From my user interviews in my target demographic (18-35 years old), I
          combined my findings with my desk research to affinity map and
          synthesize them.

        <div class="subheadML">INSIGHTS & OPPORTUNITIES</div>
        <div class="bodyML">
          I drew three insights from my synthesis and derived subsequent areas
          of opportunity from them.

        <div id="mlInsights"></div>
        <div class="hLine"></div>
        <div class="subheadML">THE SOLUTION</div>
        <div class="bigTextML">
          Create a routine of personal, meaningful reflection over time.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyML">
          By engaging individuals in consistent meaningful self-reflection,
          they’ll eventually build resilience in working through stress,
          anxiety, and other negative impacts. As result, when stressful
          situations occur, individuals will have a greater sense of control
          over their selves and mental state.

            After my first few iterations, I solidified the MVPs of the app: while the graph for inputting is the core feature, the other key features include a weekly, monthly, and yearly analysis of their inputs, as well as user-suggested next steps.

        <div class="bigTextML">Conclusions and Next Steps</div>
        <div class="bodyML">
          This was a challenging project, and not just because it was my first complete UI/UX project. I discovered that even though 
          I would plan each step in a timeline, 
          there would often be points where I would have to retrace my steps to conduct further research or devote more time to 
          iterating a certain function or feature. Since I'm also usually a big picture thinker, this project was
           an exercise and challenge in being detail-oriented, which ended up helping with big picture thinking in the long run. <br><br>
           If I were to continue this further, I would like to prototype it more thoroughly and user test it with more people, especially therapists
            and other professionals in the mental health field. An initial opportunity I wanted to explore but did not manage to build out
             via research was how well MindLog would be able to supplement therapists' work, for example in complementing their findings or 
             helping their patients establish or change specific behaviors.
