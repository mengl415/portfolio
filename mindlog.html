            <h4>problem</h4>
            <h2>
              Young adults acknowledge their mental health issues but lack
              sustainable and accessible methods of tackling them.
            </h2>
            <p>
              The topic of mental health is less stigmatized in the current
              generation of young adults, but many of us grapple with factors
              like cost, time, and resources to engage with our own mental
              health in meaningful and effective ways. How can we change this?

            <h4>desk research</h4>
            <h2>
              Perceived stress in stress-inducing experiences is a major factor
              in low mental health.
            </h2>
            <p>
              I began with desk research, and this important and surprising slap
              stat stuck out to me. Perceived stress includes all aspects of
              external sources of stress relevant to an individual rather than
              the source of stress by itself. In other words, it’s the
              individual’s feelings on how much stress they’re experiencing from
              a single source.

            <h4>User Interviews & Survey</h4>
            <p>
              From my user interviews in my target demographic (18-35 years
              old), I combined my findings with my desk research to affinity map
              and synthesize them.

            <h4>insights & opportunities</h4>
            <p>
              Through synthesizing and analyzing my research, I was able to
              pinpoint three major insights and draw subsequent areas of
              opportunity from them.

              Create a routine of personal, meaningful reflection over time.
            </h2>
            <p>
              By engaging individuals in consistent meaningful self-reflection,
              they’ll eventually build resilience in working through stress,
              anxiety, and other negative impacts. As a result, when stressful
              situations occur, individuals will have a greater sense of control
              over their selves and mental state.

          <article id="archetypes">
            <h4>user empathy</h4>
            <p>
              I created user archetypes based on the user behavior and
              preferences I gathered from my research. I specifically chose to
              create archetypes rather than personas because I wanted to focus
              more specifically on users’ needs and how to target those needs
              and felt other descriptive information in this case was
              irrelevant, as I already had a target demographic established.

            <p>
              To further empathize with the user's behavior, I created a journey
              map of current mental health help methods that would cause users
              to keep encountering hindrances to maintaining their mental
              health.

          <article id="competitor">
            <h4>competitor analysis</h4>
            <p>
              I conducted a competitor analysis on three other popular apps
              focused on mental health improvement and stress reduction.
              Overall, I found that Calm and Headspace were focused on using
              regular methods such as meditation and ASMR sounds to help the
              user without seeking to identify the causes of users' issues or
              provide insight to mental health trends. Woebot, while using
              Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, may prove too taxing or take too
              long for users to engage meaningfully with it.

              To narrow down the core features I wanted in the app, I created
              its information architecture. In doing so, I wanted to ensure
              finding content and steps is as easy and fluid as possible for
              users.

              For my design process, I began with hand-sketching, specifically
              the graphing component, as that was the most important feature and
              the one that users would engage with the most daily. I then went
              through three rounds of usability testing with the graph,
              implementing feedback I received after each round, until the rate
              of successfully mapping and reviewing points was 100%.

              I discovered that even though I would plan each step in a
              timeline, there would often be points where I would have to
              retrace my steps to conduct further research or devote more time
              to iterating a certain function or feature. Since I'm also usually
              a big picture thinker, this project was an exercise and challenge
              in being detail-oriented, which ended up helping with big picture
              thinking in the long run.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I were to continue this further, I would like to prototype it
              more thoroughly and user test it with more people, especially
              therapists and other professionals in the mental health field. An
              initial opportunity I wanted to explore but did not manage to
              build out via research was how well MindLog would be able to
              supplement therapists' work, for example in supporting their
              findings or helping their patients establish or change specific
              behaviors.
