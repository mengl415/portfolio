                            professional program, our collaborative intern
                            project was to consider how we might utilize digital
                            signage to create a more connected, communicative,
                            and joyful workplace environment while creating a
                            fluid user-experience for both our target audience
                            and the designers and content strategists on the
                            back-end.

                            Our intern cohort was tasked to leverage digital
                            signage to create a more connected and joyful
                            workplace environment while considering hybrid
                            workplace models; create and curate a smooth

                            management strategy for the back-end; and create a
                            cohesive platform relevant across all US sites. Our
                            team was responsible for solving this problem for
                            lab, research, and RXD functions.

                            For our research phase, we conducted both secondary
                            and primary research. Our secondary research
                            consisted of desk research and analogous case
                            studies of Korbyt, the digital signage platform that
                            would be used, and other similar content management
                            systems. I created a system to organize the types of
                            sources for desk research in our shared Notion,
                            which included analogous cases for reference,
                            relevant research, and the psychology of signage and
                            reading signage.

                            In our designing and prototyping phase, we began
                            with a content strategy, dividing content into
                            buckets and organizing it based on global and local
                            communications. Since a lot of our research findings
                            indicated the types of communication employees
                            received that were important and meaningful were
                            able to be categorized, we did so for the ease of
                            the content manager who would be curating and
                            delivering this news.

                            We then designed initial wireframes using our
                            content strategy, dividing and organizing layouts
                            between global and local communications, and mocked
                            up a few key screens for user testing and feedback.
                            I proposed an addition to Johnson & Johnson’s

                            the overall corporate feel and bring some more joy

                        <h4>final solution</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our final solution consisted of refined content
                            templates within Figma for content managers to
                            utilize, as well as visual indicators and
                            instructions of how the templates should be
                            integrated with Korbyt’s functions. Along with the
                            templates themselves, examples of populated screens
                            and a library of assets and custom typefaces were
                            also there for ease of use. I also created a
                            playbook that provides guidance on the brand
                            guidelines, content strategy, and hierarchy of the
                            templates, along with the basics of navigating
                            through Figma. We felt that Figma was the best space
                            for the templates and playbook to live in so it
                            could continue to evolve and change with the
                            company's guidelines and endeavors as needed.

                        <p>
                            Going into this project was very daunting, as it was
                            a project with a scope completely unfamiliar to me.
                            I’ve mostly been used to digital solutions being for
                            web or mobile applications, and I knew almost
                            nothing about laboratory or research functions.
                            However, I felt that being in a team was really
                            helpful, as even though none of us had in-depth
                            knowledge, we were able to work at building our
                            knowledge with different perspectives and
                            encouraging each other, which made the project much
                            less daunting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking back, if we were able to, it would have
                            helped our project a lot to actually visit some of
                            the sites and perhaps shadow some of the researchers
                            in their day-to-day. With more time, I would have
                            also suggested testing the displays within the
                            Johnson & Johnson Design building for a few days to
                            gather observational data and user feedback
                            physically. Overall, my team and I are proud of what
                            we were able to accomplish in a short of amount of
                            time, especially considering we all had other main
                            duties to take care of during our internship.
