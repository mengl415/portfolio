          Rebranding the Kurt Vonnegut Museum, as part of my Push10 design
          internship.

          The Kurt Vonnegut Museum houses artifacts, artwork, a museum store,
          and literature related to Vonnegut, along with exhibits and galleries
          dedicated to veteran artists. As part of my internship, I was tasked
          to rebrand the museum in its entirety, beginning with its logo, and
          finishing with a completed brand style guide.

          Time: 4.2022 - 5.2022<br /><br />Overview: rebrand the Kurt Vonnegut
          Museum's visual identity, including its logo, typography styles, color
          palette, graphic elements, and brand application mockups.<br /><br />
          Responsibilities: logo design, visual identity development, mockup
          creation<br /><br />I began with making three moodboards in a
          potential visual exploration before beginning an extensive logo
          exploration, researching Vonnegut's life and history, studying his
          illustrations and literary works, and examining the social causes and
          issues he was outspoken on.

        <div id="cLogoSketch"></div>
        <div class="cGoals">
          The final logo I decided on utilized the asterisk that appears in
          Vonnegut's <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> that also appears in many of
          his illustrations and occasionally in his signatures, along with a
          horizontal line that is also a recurring motif in Vonnegut's
          illustrations and functions as a balancing component. With the logo, I
          intended to combine the timelessness of Vonnegut's life and history
          while giving it a modern look and calling attention to his work as an
          artist as well.

        <div id="cTypography"></div>
        <div class="cGoals">
          The graphic system of the asterisk and line can be incorporated into
          headlines and other major copy text in brand applications. Headlines
          and related text can be separated by the horizontal line to indicate
          relation but still maintain separation. The line can also be placed to
          the right of text and the asterisk placed to the left of text to draw
          emphasis to text.
