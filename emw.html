          Creating a new brand identity from scratch as part of my EastMeetsWest
          Internship.

        <p class="introE">
          I collaborated with my colleague Supriya Narayanan to create the brand
          guidelines for Seoul-based B2B marketing agency EastMeetsWest. My
          primary responsibilities included the visual aspects, such as logo
          design, moodboard creation, color palette, typography pairings,
          applications, and mockups.

          Time: 10.1.2021 to 11.15.2021<br /><br />
          Overview: The client filled out a brand questionnaire which included
          details such as descriptive adjectives, company purpose, and
          demographics, which was the starting point for the brand identity
          creation.<br /><br />

        <div class="bodyE">
          The target audience is the global market, with a focus on the B2B
          segment in the Beauty & Lifestyle sector. The main target audience is
          within Korea, but we aim to have a global target market with clientele
          from outside of Korea as well. <br /><br />
          Clients would include businesses who might already have marketing
          techniques in plac or are still in beginning stages but have not been
          garnering enough positive sales or reach with their current
          strategies. Clients would also include new businesses looking to
          establish their brands in the market.

        <div class="bodyE">
          East Meets West believes that the world we live in is one big puzzle,
          merely scattered into different pieces. With the universal language of
          marketing, we aim to put the right pieces of the world's puzzle back
          to their original piece. <br /><br />
          Through our various creative marketing activities, we aim to bridge
          the gap between the east and the west and become one of the key
          players in bringing the world closer.

        <div id="eLogo"></div>
        <div class="bodyE">
          The logo embodies the brand's tones of being modern, clean, and
          abstract. The geometric letters joined together abstractly represents
          the brand's idea of connecting the east to the west, with the sea
          green acting as a subtle nod to nature.
        </div>
        <div id="eMoodboard"></div>
        <div class="bodyE">
          The idea behind the color palette and moodboard is to encapsulate
          EastMeetsWest's aim of bringing two worlds together. The primary
          colors of sea green and light blue represent the west and east
          respectively, as well as natural elements of the world, namely the sky
          and earth.
