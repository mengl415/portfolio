          During Johnson & Johnson Design Studio's 10-week professional program,
          our collaborative intern project was to consider how we might utilize
          digital signage to create a more connected, communicative, and joyful
          workplace environment while creating a fluid user-experience for both
          our target audience and the designers and content strategists on the
          back-end.

          Johnson & Johnson Design Studio Intern Project<br /><br />Time: 10
          weeks<br /><br />Opportunity: Leverage digital signage to create a
          more connected and joyful workplace environment while considering
          hybrid workplace models; create and curate a smooth user-experience
          and a content creation and management strategy for the back-end; and
          create a cohesive platform relevant across all US sites.<br /><br />
          Scope: for lab, research, and science functions.<br /><br />
          Role: UX research (desk research, interviews, surveys, affinity
          mapping, insight synthesis), UI design, brand design, visual guideline
          & playbook design.<br /><br />Team: Sophia Geanacopoulos (insights and
          experiences), Bryce Yao (industrial design), Navya Salwan (digital
          design).

          For our research phase, we conducted both secondary and primary
          research. Our secondary research consisted of desk research and
          analogous case studies of Korbyt, the digital signage platform that
          would be used, and other similar content management systems.<br /><br />
          Our primary research consisted of surveys and user interviews of both
          employees in R&D/science functions and content managers/strategists
          for Johnson & Johnson's current digital signage systems. We then
          affinity mapped all our research in Mural and generated insights based
          on our research, which then led us to our user archetypes and
          how-might-we opportunities.

          In our designing and prototyping phase, we began with a content
          strategy, dividing content into buckets and organizing it based on
          global and local communications. We then designed initial wireframes
          and a few populated key screens for user testing and feedback, which
          we conducted in two rounds with improvements between each.

        <div id="userTesting2"></div>
        <div class="jGoals">
          For our final presented solution, we created final templates for
          content managers to utilize and populated them, as well as created a
          playbook that provides guidance on the brand guidelines, content
          strategy and hierarchy, and the basics of navigating through Figma. It
          also includes information on exporting the signage from Figma into
          Korbyt and what elements of the templates are placeholders to be
          replaced with in Korbyt.<br /><br />
          We felt that Figma was the best space for the templates and playbook
          to live in so it could continue to evolve and change with the
          company's guidelines and endeavors as needed. In addition to the
          templates, example screens, and playbook themselves, we have also
          created type styles, color styles, and created components for the J&J
          variable typeface, textures, icons, and our own shape system addition
          to the brand.
