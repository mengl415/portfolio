            in a new Y2K direction.</h1>

        <p class="introABG">
        Juicy Couture is an LA-based clothing brand known for the iconic 
        Juicy velour tracksuit, growing to become a global fashion company 
        as a casual luxury brand. As part of my internship, I was tasked with
        designing a new Y2K direction for Juicy Couture Icons, encompassing logo
        designs, clothing hangtags, joker fit pant tags, and woven labels, along with general
        social media and email marketing advertisements for the 2022 holiday season.

        <div class="subheadABG">MOODBOARD</div>
        <div class="bodyABG">I began with a moodboard to take stock of Y2K trends and get an overview of 
            various potential colors, textures, and assets to create and use. This helped inspire new ideas
            for logos and packaging when I was stuck, as well as provided multiple visual directions
            to explore and refine.

        <div class=bodyABG>
            Tasked with designing with the current brand guidelines, such as the typeface used
            for "Juicy Couture," and encouraged to use the heritage symbols (the dog, cherry, and crown) as well as
            create my own, I began designing in Illustrator and exploring every possibility I could think of. I combined
            some with gradients that I had created, as well as holographic and colorful stock textures I found, and
            ended up choosing a smaller group of logos to present.

        <div class="subheadABG">CLOTHING TAGS</div>
        <div id="clothingBodyABG">
            For the clothing tags, I was tasked to design using both the Y2K direction as well as
            current Juicy heritage symbols, so I combined the two in various ways, such as Y2K colors 
            and textures with heritage symbols or vice versa. I also played with the physical texturing
            and layering of the packaging for the hangtags, designing potential vinyl or other transparent material
            patterned with symbols, as well as cutouts of the symbols.

            While the marketing advertisements for social media and email were separate from the 
            Y2K brand direction, I was tasked with creating new and interesting themes to fit the 
            photography theme, as well as a graphic and scrapbook-like style with the holiday campaign.
