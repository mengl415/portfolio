            <h2>Understanding how to foster closer friendships in college.</h2>
            <p>
              The overarching research topic for my class was “relationships,”
              and I chose the domain of friendships during college. For many,
              college is the next big step in their life, with multiple
              variables constantly changing around and within them, thus begging
              the questions: why are some people still good friends with their
              high school friends while others are not? Why do we have certain
              friends that we still consider friends even if we contact each
              other only once in a while?
            </p>
          </article>
          <article id="approach">
            <h4>approach</h4>
            <p>
              Over the course of 12 weeks, I followed the human-centered design
              approach with clear discovery, defining, ideation, and delivering
              phases.

          <article id="discovery">
            <h4>discovery</h4>
            <p>
              During my discovery phase, my research consisted of desk research,
              observational research, user interviews, surveys, and lastly,
              probe kits. I wanted to ensure I had a wide variety of research
              from various angles in order to better understand what close
              friendships looked like, how they formed, and how they were
              maintained.

            <p>
              To synthesize my findings, I affinity mapped datapoints,
              synthesized them, and deduced insights and opportunities. I also
              created user personas and mindset mapped them to gain a visual
              overview of the spread of my target demographic.

            <p>
              As the problem is maintaining current friendships rather than
              establishing new ones, I felt that it would be counter-intuitive
              to introduce a new platform or method rather than strengthen
              current ones that are used within friendships. Thus, I sketched
              out and tested my idea, Momento, an extension available in current
              messaging apps that collects images, files, and videos sent to
              create a curated and interactive Pinterest board. This idea
              stemmed from my probe kit, as it seemed participants greatly
              enjoyed collecting and creating photo collages of their past chat
              logs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did two iterations and tested each iteration, improving each
              based on the feedback grid I made from their comments.

          <article id="hi-fi">
            <h4>hi-fi solution</h4>
            <p>
              For my hi-fidelity solution, after two rounds of testing, I
              concluded that Momento indeed functions best as an extension
              within social media and messaging apps, as participants in each
              group chat responded favorably to the core features and
              familiarity of the mockup in relation to the platform. In this
              way, the memories are truly custom to each group chat and situated
              within the context of the memories and history of the group chat.
              Below are two mockup examples on Discord and Facebook Messenger.

            <p>
              By allowing group chats to easily collect and view past sent
              images and files with the context attached, users are able to
              recall memories and experiences fondly, bringing back the emotions
              and feelings they felt at the time while also feeling the urge to
              create new memories than can be looked on in the future.

            <h4>reflection</h4>
            <p>
              From this project, I learned a lot about conducting user research
              empathetically and effectively, as well as how to phrase questions
              or tasks to receive unbiased feedback. It was also generally
              enjoyable to read people's comments and reminiscing of their
              friendships, especially as I was uncovering new insights that made
              sense but I hadn't consciously thought about before.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I were to redo this project, I would spend more time conducting
              research specifically in how current close friendships are
              maintained. I recognize that that is a blind spot in my research,
              as I spent a lot of time investigating and establishing a standard
              of what close friendships looked like without allotting the same
              time to maintaining them. I also would have liked more time to iterate in the actual UI design, as the majority of my time was devoted to researching and testing.
